## Introduction

In this project, we aim to analyze COVID-19 deaths data to understand the impact of the pandemic on various countries. We explore different metrics such as daily death increase, death rate, peak death rate periods, and more. By utilizing SQL queries, we extract relevant information from the dataset and generate meaningful insights.

## Project Overview

The project includes the following components:
- SQL Queries: Analytical queries written in SQL to retrieve, transform, and analyze COVID-19 deaths data.
- Data Analysis: Calculation of metrics such as daily death increase, death rate, and identification of peak death rate periods.
- Visualization: Creation of visualizations, charts, and graphs to present the findings in an understandable and informative manner.

## Data Source

The COVID-19 deaths data used in this project is sourced from  https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. The dataset contains information on COVID-19 cases, deaths, population, and other relevant variables for different countries.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `queries.sql`: Contains the SQL queries used for data retrieval and analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- [add any additional files or directories here]
